# Machine learning with Python & Google Colab
This is a recopilation of differents notebooks over the course of my studies.

## What i've done during my Studies üìö
- I've worked in many cases of Exploratory analysis, Machine Learning and Deep learning.

#### Dormammu's new clients - Transversal exam/Case Study üè¶

The Monopoly bank has been serving its customers in Chile for many years and has recently been acquired by a foreign-capital bank named "Dormammu." Dormammu has tasked its engineers with conducting studies on Monopoly bank customers to understand their behavior and detect patterns. Additionally, they must analyze how their strategy will be to approach these new customers, given the way they use their financial products.

The computer science engineers at Monopoly bank have extracted a database based on a request from the new owner of the bank and shared it with Dormammu's engineers at their New York headquarters. The database contains a sample of customers with 12 months of information stored in variables that serve for interpretation and provide as much information as possible to the owners of this bank so they can understand the customers and prepare a strategy to address this new market. The database has variables associated with customer information for each month, i.e., one for each month. The customer is not repeated, and the associated variables are added as an additional column.

#### Counter Strike wiinnings - Transversal exam/Case Study üéÆ
In each Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match, two teams of 5 players each (referred to as terrorists and counter-terrorists) face off. The objective of the terrorist team is to plant a bomb with a 45-second timer at one of two specific sites within a map.

On the other hand, the objective of the counter-terrorist team is to prevent the bomb from being planted or to defuse it before it explodes once it has been planted.

The data to be used corresponds to over 7000 game matches (with a maximum of 10 players each). The data has been extracted from replays, which are proprietary files containing information about each action performed by each player within a match.

The replays have been extracted from the network using a scraper and pre-processed using a script. In this mini-project, we will work with the result of this preprocessing, which corresponds to a CSV file with 79,157 rows, each corresponding to a player within a match. The file contains 36 columns representing variables that describe the player's actions within the game.
